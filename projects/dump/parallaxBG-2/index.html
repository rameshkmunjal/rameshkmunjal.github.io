                    The tiger  is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera.
                     It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside.
                     An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. Tiger cubs stay with 
                       their mother for about two years, then become independent and leave their mother's home range
                        to establish their own.

                    The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. As of 2015, the global wild tiger population was 
                    estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, with most of the populations living in 
                    small isolated pockets. India currently hosts the largest tiger population. Major reasons for population
                     decline are habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching. 
                     Tigers are also victims of humanâ€“wildlife conflict, particularly in range countries with a high human
                      population density.

                    The tiger has a muscular body with powerful forelimbs, a large head and a tail that is about
                     half the length of its body. The tiger's skull is similar to a lion's skull, with the frontal 
                     region usually less depressed or flattened.The lion skull shows broader nasal openings. 
                     Due to the variation in 
                     skull sizes of the two species, the structure of the lower jaw is a reliable indicator 
                     for their identification.
