            <div class="content">
                Some of the primary symptoms to look for in a Covid 19 infected person 
                are fever, dizziness, breathlessness, headache, dry cough ( eventually 
                result in phlegm) and in a few cases loss in smell and taste. A few cases 
                have also reported diarrhoea and fatigue.

            <div class="content">
                People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms 
                at home. On average it takes 5â€“6 days from when someone is infected with the virus
                for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days.

            <div class="content">
                Though immunity through vaccination is expected to last up to nine months 
                as 'we now know', Dr. Satish said a lot of studies were under way to see if 
                everyone requires a booster dose once a year, like the flu-shot in some countries.
