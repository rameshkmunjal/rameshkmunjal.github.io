## Problem

	1) Imagine your are creating a JSON data store for a Ecommerce 
	platform like flipkart.com or amazon.in . Create a JSON to show 
	what fileds you will choose and what type of data (string/object/array) 
	would you want to store in those filed.

	2) Consider the following JSON dataset-
	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Biuni/PokemonGO-Pokedex/master/pokedex.json
	This dataset contains information of all characters of a famous game 
	Pokeman Go. Include this dataset in a JS file as a variable and then write
	the following functions -
		-write a function to take pokeman's name as argument and display the 
		 information of that pokeman.
		-write a function to take pokeman's name as argument and find out 
		 which all pokeman have that name in their "next-evolution" field .
		-write a function that take a weakness an an input and gives the names
		  of all pokemon who have that Weakness . (check the weakness array in the dataset)
		You are free to use any library if your want. Your are allowed to create multiple 
		JSON files as well if your want .
