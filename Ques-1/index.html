		<h1>Aquatic Animals</h1>
	</div>
	
	<p>
		A aquatic animal is an animal, either vertebrate or invertebrate, which lives in the water for most or all of its lifetime. 
		Many insects such as mosquitoes, mayflies, dragonflies and caddisflies have aquatic larvae, with winged adults. 
		Aquatic animals may breathe air or extract oxygen that dissolved in water through specialised organs called gills, 
		or directly through the skin. Natural environments and the animals that live in them can be categorized as aquatic (water) 
		or terrestrial (land).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The term aquatic can be applied to animals that live in either fresh water (fresh water animals) or salt water (marine animals). 
		However, the adjective marine is most commonly used for animals that live in saltwater, i.e. in oceans, seas, etc.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Aquatic animals (especially freshwater animals) are often of special concern to conservationists because of the fragility of 
		their environments. Aquatic animals are subject to pressure from overfishing, destructive fishing, marine pollution 
		and climate change.

					In addition to water breathing animals, e.g., fish, mollusks etc., the term "aquatic animal" can be applied 
					to air-breathing aquatic or sea mammals such as those in the orders Cetacea (whales) and Sirenia (sea cows),
					which cannot survive on land, as well as the pinnipeds (true seals, eared seals, and the walrus). 
					The term "aquatic mammal" is also applied to four-footed mammals like the river otter (Lontra canadensis) 
					and beavers (family Castoridae), although these are technically amphibious or semiaquatic.

					Aquatic and semiaquatic mammals are a diverse group of mammals that dwell partly or entirely in bodies of water. 
					They include the various marine mammals who dwell in oceans, as well as various freshwater species, such as the 
					European otter. They are not a taxon and are not unified by any distinct biological grouping, but rather their 
					dependence on and integral relation to aquatic ecosystems. The level of dependence on aquatic life are vastly 
					different among species, with the Amazonian manatee and river dolphins being completely aquatic and fully dependent 
					on aquatic ecosystems; whereas the Baikal seal feeds underwater but rests, molts, and breeds on land; and the capybara 
					and hippopotamus are able to venture in and out of water in search of food.

					Aquatic plants are plants that have adapted to living in aquatic environments (saltwater or freshwater).
					They are also referred to as hydrophytes or macrophytes. A macrophyte is an aquatic plant that grows in
					or near water and is either emergent, submergent, or floating, and includes helophytes (a plant that 
					grows in marsh, partly submerged in water, so that it regrows from buds below the water surface).
					In lakes and rivers macrophytes provide cover for fish and substrate for aquatic invertebrates, produce 
					oxygen, and act as food for some fish and wildlife.

				<p>
					Freshwater snails are gastropod mollusks which live in freshwater. There are many different
					families. They are found throughout the world in various habitats, ranging from ephemeral pools
					to the largest lakes, and from small seeps and springs to major rivers. The great majority of 
					freshwater gastropods have a shell, with very few exceptions. Some groups of snails that live 
					in freshwater respire using gills, whereas other groups need to reach the surface to breathe air.
					Most feed on algae, but many are detritivors and some are filter feeders.
