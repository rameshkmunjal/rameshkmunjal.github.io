##Problem Statement
	As a solution to this assignment, you are supposed to create a replica of 
	following Bootstrap components using CSS (flexbox for layout) and Jquery only. 
	You are not allowed to use bootstrap files. Here is the list of components that you 
	are supposed to create-

	1. Collapse component - accordion format.
	2. Navbar component.
	3. Modal Component.

	In your submission , you should create separate HTML, CSS  and JS file for each of 
	the components, You may create the most basic version of these components . The 
	components must be fully responsive. You are supposed to use flexboxes for responsiveness. 
	So when your HTML file is opened, it would contain one of the components. For example - The 
	Navbar and it should show the behaviour exactly as  original Bootstrap navbar . But your 
	code must not use bootstrap to create it. You are supposed to write it from Scratch.

## Synopsis
	Collapse component - accordion format.
	1) We have created a button and a content div to make accordion. 
	2) Content div has been kept hidden and its id matches with href link of button.
	3) As the button is clicked , its href link is grabbed and used as a handle to show content div.
	4) Jquery Functions have been used to toggle hide and show features .
	
	Navbar component
	1) We have created a navbar which collapses and turns into icon-bar when  screen is small or extra-small. 
	2) We have used a function to link a nav-slider with this icon-bar.
	3) When icon-bar is clicked nav-slider appears on screen and it retreats  when close button is clicked.
	
	Modal Component
	1) We have created a web page where houses are on sale.
	2) A button below every house details is given to contact agent selling this house.
   	3) When button is clicked - a modal appears and by clicking - back - button one can return to main page.
	4) We have included a form inside modal to make it more purposeful.
	5) Interested party can fill form and send it to agent. An alert of message sent appears on screen.
